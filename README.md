# ReactNodeSocketIO

A demonstration of the use of SocketIO with React and Node.

The app uses the DarkSky API, so a user will need their own API key from DarkSky and to create their own /config/keys.js file.

To get this up and running, follow these steps:

1) cd ReactNodeSocketIO
2) npm install
3) npm run client-install
4) npm start
